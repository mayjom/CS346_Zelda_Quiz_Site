		You are Nabooru, the Sage of Spirit!
		<br />
		<br />
		Nabooru is the second-in-command of the Gerudo tribe behind only Ganondorf himself. Unlike all of the other sages, Link doesn't meet her
		until very late in the story. 
		<br />
		<br />
		Upon clearing the Shadow Temple, Link learns of the final temple, located far away in the desert. After
		journeying into the desert region and earning the respect of the Gerudo tribe, Link crosses the desert and comes across the Spirit Temple.
		Initially, there is no means of entry further into the Temple, but Link learns that he must return to his childhood in order to make progress
		into the temple. Having returned to the time of his childhood, Link meets Nabooru, who explains to him that she is opposed to the way Ganondorf
		rules the tribe, and intends to thwart his plans. Nabooru, however, is too big to make it into the first half of the temple. Being the only
		one capable of going deeper inside at that point, Link makes it through the first half of the temple. When he reaches the outside of the Spirit
		Temple, he sees Nabooru get abducted by a pair of dark witches, who happen to be Ganondorf's surrogate mothers.
		<br />
		<br />
		Link then returns to the Spirit Temple as an adult. Now being able to traverse the entirety of the temple, Link ultimately makes his way to
		where the witches are waiting. Once Link confronts them they sick an Iron Knuckle (a large axe-wielding knight) on him. Upon defeating the
		Iron Knuckle, it is revealed to be Nabooru under the witches' brainwashing. Link then proceeds to do battle with the witches themselves and 
		eventually defeats them. Having been freed from the witches' influence, Nabooru awakens as the Sage of Spirit. She comments on how handsome 
		Link became when he grew up, and that she wishes she would have known sooner.
		<br />
		<br />
		Nabooru is very similar in her personality to Ganondorf, but she has her heart in the right place, unlike him. As the second-in-command of 
		the Gerudo she has her people's best interest in mind. She is young, ambitious, and rebellious, looking to take control of her tribe back from
		Ganondorf. Seeing that she harbors hatred for her tribe's king and his evil ways, she is eager to take on her role as a sage and do her
		part in saving Hyrule.
