		You are Navi the Fairy!
		<br />
		<br />
		Appointed by the Great Deku Tree, the guardian spirit of Kokiri Forest and father to the Kokiri tribe, to be Link's 
		partner and advisor in his quest as the gods' chosen hero. She mainly helps Link by giving him advice on where he 
		should go next in his quest and identifying the weaknesses of the various monsters that Link fights. Navi is a kind, 
		caring, and spirited fairy companion. She is infamous for being seen by fans as a nag or a nuisance, but it just goes 
		to show that she cares a great deal about Link's wellbeing!
