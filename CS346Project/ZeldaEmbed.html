		You are Princess Zelda!
		<br />
		<br />
		The wise, quick-witted princess of the Royal Family of Hyrule, tasked with using her intelligence and wisdom to
		guide the hero throughout his journey. Having had the same prophetic dream as Link, she eagerly awaits the
		"boy from the forest" inside Hyrule Castle. As she meets Link, she tells him of her plan to outwit Ganondorf, by collecting
		the three Spiritual Stones and opening the Door of Time, allowing the two of them make contact with the Triforce before
		Ganondorf. 
		<br />
		<br />
		This is not how things turn out, however, and Ganondorf obtains the Triforce of Power, taking over Hyrule's
		throne in the process. Having fled from Hyrule Castle with her bodyguard and attendant, Impa, she trains in secret
		for the day when Link awakens from his sleep. Having learned the ways of the mysterious and elusive Sheikah tribe from Impa,
		Zelda assumes the alter-ego known as Sheik, in order to help Link in his journey without being noticed by Ganondorf.
		<br />
		<br />
		After helping Link to purify the six temples of Hyrule, she reveals herself to him at the Temple of Time. There, she gives Link
		magical arrows imbued with holy light, which are necessary to defeating Ganondorf. Ganondorf, apparently having been wise
		to Zelda's plan the whole time, traps her in a crystal prison and warps her into his castle, where he intends to extract
		from her the Triforce of Wisdom. Will Link be able to save her?
		<br />
		<br />
		Level-headed and wise beyond her years, Princess Zelda embodies the virtue of wisdom. When Ganondorf made contact with
		the Triforce, it split up into three fragments, with only the Triforce of Power remaining with him. The Triforce of 
		Wisdom then found its home within Zelda. Secretly, she is the seventh sage of Hyrule, destined to lead the other six.
		Zelda is an ideal leader, being strong and righteous in her devotion and service to her people. She is shown to be
		exceptionally calm and collected, never losing her head in times of crisis. She uses holy magic and her Sheikah training
		to assist Link in his journey from behind the scenes.
