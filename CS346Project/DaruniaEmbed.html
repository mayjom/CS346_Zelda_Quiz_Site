		You are Darunia, the Sage of Fire!
		<br />
		<br />
		The mighty chief of the mountain-dwelling Goron tribe, a race of friendly, vaguely human-shaped rock monsters. Though they lived high up
		in Hyrule's mountains, the Goron tribe maintained contact with the Royal Family of Hyrule. The second Spiritual Stone that Link must collect
		is located within the Goron City.
		<br />
		<br />
		Prior to Link's arrival there, Ganondorf had attempted to coerce Darunia into giving up the Goron's Ruby.
		After Darunia had denied him the stone, Ganondorf used his magic to seal off a nearby cave where the Gorons went to eat rocks. Faced with this 
		problem, Darunia makes Link the deal that if he can open up the cave and defeat the monsters that roam within it, then he will give Link 
		the Goron's Ruby. After Link clears the cave of monsters, Darunia, overjoyed, gives Link the Goron's Ruby and the brotherly kinship of the 
		Goron tribe.
		<br />
		<br />
		After Link awakens from his seven-year slumber, he returns to the Goron City to find that all of the Gorons except for Darunia's
		son have gone missing. Darunia's son, whom he named after Link, explains that Ganondorf had come once again and resurrected, Volvagia, an 
		ancient fire dragon who had long been an enemy of the Gorons. Ganondorf's followers had taken the Gorons captive and imprisoned them within 
		the Fire Temple, located inside a volcano near the Goron City. The Gorons were then to be eaten by Volvagia. Link the Goron then states that 
		his father Darunia had gone ahead into the Fire Temple to try and confront Volvagia.
		<br />
		<br />
		Early upon entering the Fire Temple, Link meets Darunia, who goes to where Volvagia waits. After going through the Fire Temple and freeing all 
		of the captive Gorons, Link confronts Volvagia an defeats it using the Megaton Hammer, a weapon said to have been wielded by a legendary Goron hero. 
		Upon clearing the Fire Temple, Darunia awakens as the Sage of Fire, reminding Link of his brotherly kinship with the Gorons.
		<br />
		<br />
		Darunia is a passionate individual who is quite proud of his strength. He can come off as somewhat intimidating at first, based on his size
		and the fierceness in his tone of voice. However, once one gains his respect, he can be seen to be quite jovial and demonstrative of the
		Gorons' tradition of brotherly love. He is a tough and reliable leader who will never let his people, or his "brothers", down.
