		You are Saria, the Sage of the Forest!
		<br />
		<br />
		Saria is a member of the Kokiri tribe and a childhood friend of Link's. She is popular among the other Kokiri and well-liked for her
		pleasant disposition. When Link leaves on his journey, she is saddened to see him go, and gives him the ocarina that she used to play.
		Saria enjoys going out into the deep woods to be among nature and play her ocarina. While Link is gathering the Spiritual Stones, he
		meets Saria in the Sacred Forest Meadow, where she teaches him "Saria's Song". This song enables Link to communicate with
		Saria over long distances and to seek her advice in his quest.
		<br />
		<br />
		After Link awakens from his long sleep, he returns to Kokiri Forest to find it overrun with monsters and the Kokiri afraid to leave 
		their homes. With the Great Deku Tree dead, there is no entity to keep the
		forest safe from danger. It is no coincidence that Saria finds herself drawn to the Sacred Forest Meadow. The meadow is the site of the 
		Forest Temple, an ancient stronghold nestled deep in the forest and forgotten to time. After Link defeats the dark phantom responsible for 
		the curse on the Forest Temple, Saria awakens as the Sage of the Forest. In the Great Deku Tree's meadow, a new Deku Tree Sprout appears
		thanks to the curse on the Forest Temple being lifted. Saria promises to Link that their friendship will never disappear, even with her
		new role as a sage.
		<br />
		<br />
		The Kokiri are unique in that they never grow old physically, staying in the form of a child for the entirety of their lives. Being
		the children of the forest, all Kokiri are given a guardian fairy by the Great Deku Tree. Although Link was raised as one, he is revealed to 
		be a Hylian by the Great Deku Tree's Sprout, rather than a Kokiri. When Link returns to Kokiri Forest as an adult, Saria is the only one who
		recognizes him. Saria is a very kind and empathetic girl who deeply values the friendships she forms with others. It is likely because of 
		this that she is very popular among her tribe. As a friend, she is loyal to a fault and is one of Link's closest allies in his quest.
