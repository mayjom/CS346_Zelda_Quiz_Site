		You are the Great King of Evil, Ganondorf!
		<br />
		<br />
		A powerful and wickedly cunning warlock hailing from Hyrule's desert region. In the desert-dwelling Gerudo tribe, it is
		established that only one male Gerudo is born every one hundred years. This male is destined to become their king. Under
		the ruse of wanting a better life for his people, Ganondorf travels to Hyrule Castle in a diplomatic mission to negotiate
		with Hyrule's king. However, unbeknownst to everyone except the young Princess Zelda, he has been attempting to coerce
		the various tribes of Hyrule into giving him the Spiritual Stones required to enter the Sacred Realm where the Triforce resides.
		Among them, he casts a death-dealing curse upon the Great Deku Tree, the guardian spirit of Kokiri Forest, for refusing to give
		up the Spiritual Stone that resides there.
		<br />
		<br />
		As fate would have it, before even opening the Door of Time, Ganondorf had ransacked Hyrule Castle and chased Zelda and Impa out. 
		As Link opened the Door of Time using the namesake Ocarina of Time, he had plunged into his seven-year sleep and the door to the 
		Sacred Realm was left wide open. Ganondorf successfully made contact with the
		Triforce, but since his heart was wicked and not in perfect balance, only the piece of the Triforce that most resonated with
		his heart remained. Even though he only possessed the Triforce of Power, its might was more than enough for him to completely
		take over the land of Hyrule. The Triforce divided, Ganondorf's new goal was to find the people who possessed to other two
		Triforce fragments that had escaped him.
		<br />
		<br />
		In the seven years since Link fell into slumber, Ganondorf plunged the land into
		darkness, setting plagues upon the various regions of Hyrule and placing curses upon the kingdom's six sacred temples.
		Ganondorf was well aware of the prophecy himself, and these actions were all a part of a plan to draw out the two with
		the remaining Triforce fragments. After Link had rid the temples of Ganondorf's curses, he succeeded in luring Zelda out of
		hiding, capturing her and trapping her in his castle. He goaded and taunted Link, daring him to come to his castle and save the
		Princess. This, too, was part of his plan to reunite the three with the Triforce...
		<br />
		<br />
		A powerful Gerudo warlock with a wicked heart and dark ambition, he embodies the virtue(?) of power. When he made contact with the
		Triforce, only the fragment embodying power remained with him. However, the power it granted him would give him the means to make his
		dark desires reality and potentially allow him to regather the rest of the Triforce. This would allow him access to the absolute power
		of the gods of Hyrule, and enable him to truly recreate the world as he would have it. He is manipulative and treacherous to the point
		of betraying his own people, using his status as the King of the Gerudo to get close to Hyrule's king. He is also ruthless, using his
		black magic to threaten the way of life of any tribe that would stand in the way of his goals. Despite his brutish and violent disposition,
		Ganondorf is extremely cunning, being able to see through Zelda's plan for most of the story.
