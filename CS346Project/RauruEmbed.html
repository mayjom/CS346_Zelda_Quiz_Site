		You are Rauru, the Sage of Light!
		<br />
		<br />
		Shortly after Link leaves Kokiri Forest at the beginning of his quest, he is met by an old, wise owl by the name of Kaepora Gaebora. This 
		mysterious owl continues to meet Link at every new locale that he visits almost as though he knows where Link is going to go... He tells
		Link, with every meeting, useful information about the various locales found in Hyrule and things that he ought to know going into them.
		<br />
		<br />
		Upon Link's opening the Door of Time, Rauru reveals to Link that he has been watching him all throughout his journey in his childhood.
		He is the only sage to be awake from the very beginning of the story. Although it is never established explicitly in the story, certain
		gossip reveals that Rauru was indeed the owl who kept a watchful eye on Link as he gathered the Spiritual Stones in his childhood.
		<br />
		<br />
		Rauru is the sage of the Temple of Light(Time), who has long waited for the chosen hero to awaken to his destiny. Possessing the ability to
		leave the Sacred Realm in the form of an owl, he keeps a watchful eye on Link as he grows stronger from the trials he endures as a child.
		Rauru is old and very wise, passing his knowledge of Hyrule's various locations on to Link. Rauru also seems to have a something of a 
		fatherly relationship with Link, as from the way he speaks to Link in the earlier part of his journey, he expresses deep concern and 
		caring for Link's safety. Rauru/Kaepora Gaebora is seen by some fans as being a nuisance, as he frequently repeats himself when meeting 
		Link out in Hyrule, but that really drives home the point that Link is never alone in his quest.
