		You are Impa, the Sage of Shadow!
		<br />
		<br />
		Impa is the last survivng member of the elusive Sheikah tribe, a clan who had long served the Royal Family of Hyrule from the shadows. 
		Hailing from the nearby Kakariko Village, this town was originally a Sheikah town. When Impa was appointed to be Princess Zelda's attendant,
		Impa opened the village up to all the people of Hyrule.
		<br />
		<br />
		Link first meets Impa immediatley after speaking with Zelda for the first time. Impa
		teaches Link "Zelda's Lullaby", which is a song that shows ties to the Royal Family of Hyrule and exhibits mysterious powers throughout 
		the story. Once Ganondorf makes his move on Hyrule Castle, Impa takes Zelda to safety and teaches her the ways of the Sheikah tribe.
		<br />
		<br />
		Once Link awakens from his slumber and has liberated the Forest, Fire, and Water Temples, he comes to Kakariko Village to find it in flames. Link finds
		Sheik, staring down the well in the center of the village. He explains to Link that Kakariko Village has been terrorized by an unseen force
		that escaped from imprisonment at the bottom of the well. It is also explained that Impa had gone into the Shadow Temple, located behind
		Kakariko's graveyard to deal with the shadowy phantom from the well. After traversing the nightmarish void that is the Shadow Temple, 
		Link defeats the phantom and Impa awakens as the Sage of Shadow. Impa requests that Link look after Princess Zelda in her absence.
		<br />
		<br />
		Being that Impa has the appearance of a ninja here, it can be inferred that the Sheikah were likely trained as warriors of stealth 
		and deception. Given the nature of this upbringing, Impa comes off as a staunchly loyal and hard-nosed person. She is fiercely devoted
		to the protection of both her village of Kakariko and of Princess Zelda. She also serves as something of a mentor to Zelda, in addition 
		to being her attendant.
