			Welcome to the Great Zelda Personality Inventory! This is a project in its infant stage designed to be an ever-growing,
			large-scale personality inventory based on Nintendo's popular video game franchise, The Legend of Zelda. As of right now,
			the site only consists of some of the major characters from what is arguably Nintendo's most iconic game in this franchise,
			The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The result pages have (at least for now) been written in a way such that a person who
			has never even heard of this game can get a good idea of the game's story and a look at what the characters are like
			personality-wise. All information in the character descriptions is based on the author's experience with the game. 
			All currently-existing quiz results are located in the list to the left. Happy quizzing!
