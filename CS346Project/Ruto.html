		You are Princess Ruto, the Sage of Water!
		<br />
		<br />
		The young princess of the fish-like Zora tribe. The Zoras maintained close contact with the Royal Family of Hyrule and were tasked with 
		guarding Hyrule's primary waterway and lake, known as Lake Hylia.
		<br />
		<br />
		When Link enters Zora's Domain looking for the final Spiritual Stone,
		the Zora's Sapphire, he learns from the Zora's that their young Princess, Ruto, had recently gone missing. After some investigating, Link
		finds a letter written by Ruto to her father, the Zora King. Ruto had written that she had gotten herself eaten by the Zoras' deity, 
		Lord Jabu-Jabu, and intended to find the Zora's Sapphire, which Jabu-Jabu had swallowed sometime before. Tasked with saving Ruto from
		Jabu-Jabu's belly, Link enters inside the creature's mouth and eventually meets up with Ruto. Snobbishly, Ruto agrees to let Link carry her
		through Jabu-Jabu's belly while they search for the Zora's Sapphire. They eventually come across the Spiritual Stone and then Ruto gets 
		separated from Link. After defeating the parasite that had been causing Jabu-Jabu pain, Link and Ruto safely make it out of his belly. 
		Ruto gives Link the Zora's Sapphire, saying that her mother told her to give it to the one she would eventually marry, apparently having
		grown rather fond of Link during their adventure.
		<br />
		<br />
		Seven years later, after Link returns to Zora's Domain, he finds the entire place frozen
		over with ice. Sheik, a mysterious man helping Link from the shadows, explains to him that Ganondorf placed a curse on the Water Temple,
		located at the bottom of Lake Hylia. The curse resulted in most of the water draining from Lake Hylia and was also responsible for the 
		frozen state of Zora's domain. Shortly after entering the Water Temple, Link meets Ruto, who reveals that Sheik had helped her out from 
		under the ice. She mentions to Link that she has not forgotten their marriage vows, but that she will disregard them in order to help 
		her people out. After defeating the monster behind the curse on the Water Temple, the water that had drained from Lake Hylia returns and
		Zora's Domain eventually thaws. Ruto awakens as the Sage of Water and expresses regret that she was not able to properly thank Sheik 
		for helping her.
		<br />
		<br />
		Being the princess of the Zora tribe, Ruto tends to act a bit like a spoiled daddy's-girl. She initially is quite snobbish toward Link, but
		seemingly takes a liking to his strength and bravery as they spend more time together. Depite her attitude, Ruto is also bold and rather 
		headstrong, which leads to her being a potentially strong leader to her people. Couple this with a suprisingly strong sense of duty to her 
		people, and chances are you have a pretty solid ruler! This is exemplified by the fact that she is capable of setting her feelings for Link
		aside in order to fulfill her duty as a sage.
