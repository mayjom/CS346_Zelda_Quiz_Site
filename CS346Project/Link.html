		You are the Hero of Time, Link!
		<br />
		<br />
		The eternal hero, chosen by destiny to rise up against the forces of evil in the kingdom of Hyrule.
		Beginning his journey as a young lad in Kokiri Forest, he has a prophetic dream of Princess Zelda
		being chased out of Hyrule Castle on horseback by an ominous-looking man clad in black armor.
		After traveling to Hyrule Castle to meet Princess Zelda, who shared the same prophetic dream as Link, he
		is tasked with finding three Spiritual Stones required to open a door in the Temple of Time. Link 
		eventually learns that the Temple of Time is the gateway to the Sacred Realm where the Triforce, a mystical
		artifact that embodies the power of the gods, resides. Needless to say, this is what the man from Link's
		vision, Ganondorf, is after. He also learns that the Temple of Time is the resting place of the legendary
		Master Sword, the only weapon capable of defeating Ganondorf.
		<br />
		<br />
		Upon inevitably drawing the Master Sword from its pedestal, Link goes into a deep sleep for seven years. In this time, 
		Ganondorf has succeeded in taking one of the three fragments of the Triforce (the Triforce of Power) and has plunged
		Hyrule into darkness. Having grown seven years older, Link begins a new quest to purify six temples throughout Hyrule that have been
		cursed by Ganondorf. In purifying the temples, Link helps to awaken six sages who are destined to watch over
		Hyrule from the Sacred Realm. Aided by the power of the sages, Link heads to Ganon's Castle to confront the
		Great King of Evil...
		<br />
		<br />
		Being the "Hero of Time", Link embodies the virtue of courage. When Ganondorf made contact with the Triforce,
		it split up into three fragments, with only the Triforce of Power remaining with him. The Triforce of Courage
		then found its home within Link. He is the strong, silent type and doesn't tend to speak very much. A strong
		and brave warrior, Link carries the fate of Hyrule on his shoulders, overcoming a great many trials and hardships 
		in his quest to dethrone Ganondorf. No matter how many times he is struck down, he gets right back up and continues
		the fight until the day is won.
